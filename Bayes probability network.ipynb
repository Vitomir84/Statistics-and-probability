    "### Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different probability interpretations. With Bayesian probability interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. "
